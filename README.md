A Belgian painter, the son of a chocolatier, who trained to be a dentist as he had a hatred of sweet things.
During his training he developed a love for straight lines and bold colours, predominantly red, blue and yellow.

After becoming a painter he used absinthe heavily, on one occasion cutting off his left nose and posting it to reddit.

He invented a new art medium, recursively generated painting. The style later dubbed as "Dojoism".

He is also a Python core contributor.
